# HR_system
Here is a sample of my first selenium project using java and TestNG framwork that used on HR system that run test cases on both browsers (chrome-firfox),
so have a look and tell me your opinion as for first project ;)
--------
 AS for (employee.java) class that is attched their is 6 functions that employee can do  
1- (add-edit-delete) vacation request 
2-(add-edit-delete) mandates request 
that i choose 15 test case to automate (positive-negative) scenarios 

And for (corefun.java) class that contains most repeated functions that i will be using across all of the project like (login-add vacation-add mandate) functions 

For (HR.Employee.run.xml) that is the XML that i run from that contains all my parameters and sequences of the methods that i need to run my project according to it  in employee class   

At last (Happy moment every tester should feel it.png) reason of being happy not just that all test cases run succssfully but also for the confidance that you aquire in your software after each change and the great one (Time) u saved as time is the most valuable thing we own so we have to spend it wisly :)
