# HR_system
Here is a sample of my first selenium project using java and TestNG framwork that used on HR system that run test cases on both browsers (chrome-firfox)
so have a look and tell me your opinoun as for first project :D 
--------
As for (employee.java) class that is attched their is 6 functions that employee can do  
1- (add-edit-delete) vacation request 
2-(add-edit-delete) mandates request 
that tested by 15 test case (positive-negative) scenarios 

As for (corefun.java) class that contains most repeated functions that i will be using across all of the project like (login-add vacation-add mandate) functions 

For (HR.Employee.run.xml) that is the XML that i run from that contains all my parameters and sequences of the methods in employee class
